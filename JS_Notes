Day 2: 
  transform-origin style: This moves the origin of an object. By default it is 50% which is in the middle of the object, but 0% puts the 
  origin on the left side of the object, and 100% puts it on the right side.
  
  transition style: This makes any changes happen over some interval in seconds.
Day 3:
  So basically, this is teaching us to be able to put variables in our CSS. This is done
  by creating a :root style and puting the variables in there. An example looks like this:
    :root {
      --base: #ffc600;
      --spacing: 10px;
      --blur: 10px;
    }
  So -- before a name indicates that it is a variable. This is then used in the actual tags liket his:
    img {
      padding: var(--spacing);
      background: var(--base);
      filter: blur(var(--blur));
    }
  These have to be declared as a variable taking some sort of value.
  
  New event listener: 'change'
    - I assume that this is called whenever an input is changed. Maybe it can only be listened
    for on inputs?
    
  New event listener: 'mousemove'
    - Is pretty self-explanatory, but just be aware of its existence.
    
  Reminder: a data attribute is something that you have made up.
  
  Using this.dataset will show you all of the attributes in a tag that are data attributes
